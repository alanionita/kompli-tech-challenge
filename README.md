# Kompli Tech Challenge

My solution for the Kompli Tech Challenge using Node, Express, and MongoDB.

The plan of action:
- use a generic email address from the University of Groningen (communicatie@rug.nl)
- scrape the https://www.rug.nl/about-us/how-to-find-us/contact 
- find email addresses 
- find phone numbers
- find address
- move on to the wider domain https://www.rug.nl to validate accuracy

**This is a WIP readme**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

#### node.js

node.js must be installed on your machine (any versions will work; v7.10.0 was used for this project)

```
$ node -v // v7.10.0
```

To install node follow this guide -  https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#osx

#### npm

npm is required (any versions will work; v4.2.0 was used for this project)

```
$ npm -v // 4.2.0
```

To install npm follow this guide - https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

#### mongoDB

mongoDB is required since it was the database of choice.

To install mongoDB follow this guide -  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

Alternative you can use Robo 3T (a mongoDB management tool) to test whether the databses have been created correctly (we do this after running the seed file) - https://robomongo.org

### Install

Create a new folder on your machine and clone / fork + clone the repo. 

Open terminal and navigate to the folder storing the code

Install all of the required packages using npm

```
$ npm i  
```

### Start the server

#### Start mongoDB 

In a separate terminal window start mongod by running the following command.

```
$ mongod
```
Make sure no other clients are accessing the mongo ports. If they are locate the processes an stop them.

#### Seeding the database 

Navigate to the server folder and open the 'seed' folder.

Run the following command.

```
$ npm run seed:dev
```

This will populate the DEV database. It's only necessary for the DEV db because the TEST database is dropped and re-seeded before each block of tests.

```javascript
let usefulData;
  beforeEach((done) => {
    mongoose.connection
      .dropDatabase()
      .then(saveTestData) // where saveTestData is seed/test.seed.js
      .then((data) => {
        usefulData = data;
        console.log(`Useful data: ${Object.keys(usefulData)}`);
        done();
      })
      .catch(done);
  });
```

Test if the database was seeded by running Robo 3T or running the project test suite

#### Start the server

Navigate back to the route server folder and run the following command.

```
$ npm run dev
```

Your should see this as the last lines of the output

```
listening on port 3000
connected to the dev database
```

#### Visually navigating the API 

In the browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and follow the instructions available there. All of the routes are listed and described on http://localhost:3000/api


## Running the tests

The tests are built using Mocha, Chai, and Supertest

To run the tests, type the following command in your terminal anywhere withing the project folder

```
$ npm t
```

The tests give a good summary of all of the routes and what features they have.

### Testing patterns

GET routes 

```javascript
it('responds with status code 200', (done) => {
    request(server) // imported from supertest
        .get('/')
        .end((err, res) => {
          if (err) done(err);
          else {
            const output =
              '<h1>Welcome to the Hacker News Clone API</h1> \n Go to /api for more...';
            expect(res.status).to.equal(200);
            expect(res.text).to.equal(output);
            done();
        }
    });
});
```

POST and PUT routes

```javascript

it('responds with status code 200 & returns new comment', (done) => {
    // uses model methods
    Articles.findOne({}, (err, article) => { 
    // finds a random article from the databases in order to pass it as a param to the post/put route 
    if (err) done(err);
    request(server)
        .post(`/api/articles/${article._id}/comments`)
        .send({ body: 'this is a test comment' })
        .end((error, res) => {
            if (error) done(error);
            expect(res.status).to.equal(200);
            expect(res.body.newComment).to.be.an('object');
            expect(res.body.newComment.body).to.equal('this is a test comment');
            done();
        });
    });
});
```
