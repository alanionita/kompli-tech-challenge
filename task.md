We often get email addresses from our clients (ex: tim@canddi.com).

Given this data we’d really like to obtain additional information about the company (Address, Phone Number, Other Email Addresses etc…).

The task is to build a Node.js console based web-scraper - which given an email address, visits the web-page and programmatically extracts any relevant information to echo to the screen.
